I'm JT Booth, and I write about software and stuff. Broadly, I think that software focuses too much on hard problems, and not enough on usability and experience. I think if it's worth doing, it's worth getting good enough that you can do it easily. I'll apply this to programming, language learning, and anything else I think about for more than four seconds.

My particular interests within software are frontend web development, database schemas, user metrics, and writing clearly error-free code. Outside of software, I'm into Magic: The Gathering and similar board/video games, weightlifting & fitness, and the Japanese language. I live in Tokyo with my fiance Chisa Koiwa, and I start(ed) work(ing) for Stripe Tokyo in November 2021.

I generally see a world with a ton of CRUD-shaped holes in it, and my medium term goal is to develop my own skills at filling those holes. I think my major deficiency is in project discipline, but I haven't found a way to train that yet. So, in stead I'm practicing web development (cf: Streetlight Fallacy). 

I like Paul Graham, Patio11, Serinemolecule, and Astral Codex Ten. They're good.
