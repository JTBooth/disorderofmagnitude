This is generally what I'm up to here. It's mostly for me, but you can read it if you want. I intend the rest of the context to be more useful to people who aren't me.

# Minimum Useful Writing
I goal switch constantly, usually without producing any useful artifacts. This is very fun, and sometimes educational, but can be kind of sad when I look backwards. It's hard to convince myself that I'm doing that much productive work at all. Quite likely this is because I'm not. Unlucky.

What is lucky is that most of the time, these projects are programming, so at least I'm getting better at that. Just, not in any goal-directed, coherent sort of way. So, it can be hard to see the value in that, too. Again, quite likely because I'm not. 

With that, I come to two and two-halves general goals, which I choose to embody in this nice free Jekyll-y blog.

## Recording Progress
I think I'm at least running into useful concepts. It's just that I'm forgetting them, and then forgetting I ever even knew them. This leaves me with a sort of scattered collection of "oh yeah I remember that!" plus the suspicion that I've wasted my life. So, I'm going to write stuff down as I learn about it. This will hopefully help me learn it better, remember later that I did something useful with my time, and serve as a reference, to me and possibly someone else.

## Directing Investigation
As I start to fill out this cloud of tech explanations and essays and such, I hope I'll be able to build a more cohesive body of knowledge, focus on weak spots, form connections, and generally get all "spiderweb of red yarn on a corkboard" with it.

### Writing as a Skill
I do software, which is confusing and difficult. But, it's a lot easier if you understand it. People quite like it when you explain things to them, and I'd like to get better at doing that. Same goes for persuasive writing, except in that case I get to be happy rather than the other people.

### Proof of Work
Very relatedly, sometimes people hire you for having skills, such as writing, and the kind I want to write about. Possibly someone will read this, see that I know things, see that I can explain things, and decide that they would rather like to be my friend and/or give me lots of money, possibly contingent on me continuing to do those things.

# Challenges!
I lied, there's one challenge. It's my incredibly short attention span. I hope to increase it and to compensate for it. Accordingly, I will be writing very, very short things. As short as can possibly be useful. This ties into some other things I believe, such as "most big problems aren't difficult, they're just things no one has done yet" and "writing should be as clear accessible as possible, even sacrificing aesthetics and precision." But mostly it's because I know I'll get bored otherwise.

So, that's the plan. See you all eventually.
